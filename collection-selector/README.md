# Collection Selector

### Problem Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing the methods of a class much like `java.util.Collections`. The `Selector.java` file defines a class with static methods that implement polymorphic algorithms that operate on and/or return objects that implement the `Collection` interface. Each method of `Selector` is clearly specified, is independent of the other methods in the class, and is designed to provide relatively simple functionality. So, this is a great context in which to practice systematic, disciplined development and test-based verification.
